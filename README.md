The aim of this project is to choose the candidate regression model among five, which performs the best in predicting the EEG signals using R programming language.
Performed preliminary data analysis which includes time series study, each EEG signal distributions and correlations of the signals.
Applied statistical techniques such as estimate model parameters, finding residual sum of squared errors(RSS), Log-Likelihood values, Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) calculations, error distributions to understand the relationship between the EEG signals for each model. 
The best candidate regression model has selected based on the above factors and performed confidence intervals and error bar calculations for model validation.
Computed the posterior distributions by using the Rejection ABC method on selected candidate model followed by joint and marginal posterior distribution plots.
I used RStudio to perform the tasks using R language
